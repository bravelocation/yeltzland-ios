1. I've added a new "game time tweets" option. 

This will send you notifications whenever there is a new Twitter post just before/during/just after a game.

It's off by default, so you've have to turn it on if you want to see the alerts. Obviously you won't actually see any until the new season starts in August!

2. I've also added a refresh button to the Twitter page to make it easier to update (and it refreshes itself every minute now anyway)
